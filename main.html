	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a computational concept that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms are designed to minimize time complexity, ensuring faster performance even with large inputs.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run as a function of the length of the input. Space Complexity is often expressed in Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates how the memory usage grows with the input size.</p>
